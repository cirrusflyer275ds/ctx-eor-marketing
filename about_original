# About CTX-EOR

Hiring has changed.  
We're here to help you change with it ‚Äî without guesswork, friction, or risk.

## Built for the Future of Work

CTX-EOR was founded to help U.S.-based companies hire smarter.  
We believe in **trial-based hiring**, **structured evaluations**, and **compliant payroll infrastructure** ‚Äî because the future demands more than temp help or outsourcing gimmicks.

In a market flooded with vague promises and global complexity, we stay grounded:
- **U.S. compliance**
- **North American employers**
- **Real-world hiring results**

We're not a temp agency.  
We're not a shadow staffing firm.  
We're your **Employer of Record**, your **payroll platform**, and your **hiring operations system** ‚Äî rolled into one.
