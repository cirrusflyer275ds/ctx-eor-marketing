      <h3>Built for the Future of Work</h3>
      <p>CTX-EOR was founded to help U.S.-based companies hire smarter. We believe in <strong>trial-based hiring</strong>, <strong>structured evaluations</strong>, and <strong>compliant payroll infrastructure</strong> &mdash; because the future demands more than temp help promises and global complexity. We stay grounded:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>U.S. compliance</strong></li>
        <li><strong>North American employers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Real-world hiring results</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're not a temp agency. We're not a shadow staffing firm. We're your <strong>Employer of Record</strong>, your <strong>payroll platform</strong>, and your <strong>hiring operations system</strong> &mdash; rolled into one.</p>
